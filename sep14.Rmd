# Relationship between rainfall and harvest

I want to predict the harvest based on the
most recent rainfall data prior to the
harvest.

This is a new line.

```
harvest <- c(150,145,55,70,180,150)
rain <- c(30,32,18,24,38,32)
lm(harvest ~ rain)
lm(harvest ~ 1)
mean(harvest)
```

Don't want the code?

Add `echo=FALSE`.

Don't want to run the code? `eval=FALSE`

- Italics `*asterisk*` *asterisk*
- Bold `**bold**`
- Lists
  - Subitem

2\. List
4\. Items

Equations: $y_{t} = x_{t}$

$$y_{t} = x_{t}$$

Line  
break

Inline code: `print("hello")` this in the line
